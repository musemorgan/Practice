Instructions
Consider the definition of the function main in the provided file main.cpp:

The variables x, y, z, rate, and hours referred to in the bullets below are the variables of the function main. 
Each of the functions described must have the appropriate parameters to access these variables. 
Write the following definitions:

1. Write the definition of the function initialize that initializes x and y to 0 and z to the blank character.

2. Write the definition of the function getHoursRate that prompts the user to input the hours worked and rate
 per hour to initialize the variables hours and rate of the function main.

3. Write the definition of the value-returning function paycheck that calculates and returns the amount to be
 paid to an employee based on the hours worked and rate per hour. 
 The hours worked and rate per hour are stored in the variables hours and rate, respectively, 
 of the function main.

The formula for calculating the amount to be paid is as follows:

For the first 40 hours, the rate is the given rate; for hours over 40, the rate is 1.5 times the given rate.

Write the definition of the function printCheck that prints the hours worked, rate per hour, and the salary.

Write the definition of the function funcOne that sets the value of x and y to 35 and 20 respectively.
 Then prompt the user to input a number. The function then changes the value of x by assigning the value of
  the expression two times the (old) value of x plus the value of y minus the value entered by the user.

Write the definition of the function nextChar that sets the value of z to the next character stored in z.
An example of the program is shown below:

After initialization: x = 0, y = 0, z =  
Enter hours worked: 60

Enter pay rate: 20

Hours worked:       60
Pay Rate:           $20
This week's salary: $1400
Before calling funcOne: x = 35, y = 20
Enter an integer: 
2

After funcOne: x = 88
z = B
After nextChar: z = C
