//This folder is tracking all the projects i am doing to jog my memory of C++ before the start of my Data structures course
// The projects start at Basic.cpp and move through each lesson (basics, Lesson2, L3, L4...).
//The goal has been to upload only working projects.
// L files (Lesson2, L3, L4...) are lesson files from my 7 day lesson play to relearn C++ while P files are practice files 
//where I create examples to practice small learnings.
